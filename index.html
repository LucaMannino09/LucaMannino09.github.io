                    <h2>What is this site?</h2>
                    <p>This is a site made for my I.T. class for my HTML final. The goal of this final project is to
                        prove that we, the students, are capable of creating our own website without any help from our
                        teacher. In my opinion, I felt that this was a fairly simple and easy project, since we have
                        learned quite a lot about HTML this school year, and VS Code also has helped us save lots of
                        time.</p>

                    <h2>Why is this site special?</h2>
                    <p>Why is this site in particular special? Well, I feel that it does a good job of showing almost
                        everything that we have learned this year. Now, obviously this is still a very basic website
                        with limited CSS, but it still shows a lot. For one, it shows off how we learned about using
                        divs to make boxes inside of different boxes. Also, there are links on the right side, which is
                        using the anchor tag.</p>

                    <p>Come visit my about page! This page tells you about who I am and what I like to do outside of
                        computers.</p>

                    <p>Please come and try my game, I have spent a lot of time creating this game. However, it is still
                        not complete, but you can still do a lot of things while you are waiting for any updates.</p>
